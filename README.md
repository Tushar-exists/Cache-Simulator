# Cache-Simulator
Cache Memory is a special very high-speed memory. It is used to speed up and synchronizing with high-speed CPU. Cache memory is costlier than main memory or disk memory but economical than CPU registers. Cache memory is an extremely fast memory type that acts as a buffer between RAM and the CPU. It holds frequently requested data and instructions so that they are immediately available to the CPU when needed. Cache memory is used to reduce the average time to access data from the Main memory. The cache is a smaller and faster memory which stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations. There are various different independent caches in a CPU, which store instructions and data.


The data or contents of the main memory that are used frequently by CPU are stored in the cache memory so that the processor can easily access that data in a shorter time. Whenever the CPU needs to access memory, it first checks the cache memory. If the data is not found in cache memory, then the CPU moves into the main memory. In this project, we aim to simulate the working of a cache memory, implementing different types of mapping, and hence, determine and analyse the performance of the cache memory by calculating the hit ratio, compulsory misses, capacity misses, and conflict misses.
